# BIT 115: Introduction to Programming Syllabus
  ***BIT 115/Section 02 /5 Credits/Winter 2022***


## Course Information
**Course Delievery**: In-person  
**Learning Materials**: All the learning materials, including exercises and assignments, have been arranged on a lecture basis on Canvas(***cascadia.instructure.com***)   
**Instructor Name**: Nureni Adeyemo   
**How to Contact Me**: Canvas Message is the primary way of reaching me. Alternatively, you can contact me using my Cascadia Email address: ***nadeyemo@cascadia.edu***. *I will respond to your messages or emails not later than 48 hours, except weekends and public holidays.*    

## Course Description
This introductory programming class emphasizes problem solving through exploration of 
computer programming, variable typing and assignment, basic control structures loops, 
branches,  functions,  subprograms,  and  arrays  using  a  language  such  as  Java.  Students  also explore how human culture affects the use of computer programs.    .

## Prerequisites:  
Completion of MATH 085 or MFUND 062 with a grade of 2.0 or higher or placement by testing 
into MATH 095 or above.

## Workplace Context
*How will the outcomes from this class be used in the workplace?*   
*Scenario*:  Shira  is  hired  to  create  a  simple  address  book  with  a  graphical  user  interface.  She designs  an  interface,  creates  algorithms  dealing  with  basic  input  and  processing  of  names, addresses and phone numbers. She presents the design to the company and then implements the program and tests that it functions properly.

## Required Textbook
* **Title**: Think Java: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist 
* **Authors**: Allen B. Downey and Chris Mayfield
* **Publisher**: O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2nd Edition (2020)
* **Language**: English
* **ISBN**: 978-0135166307

1. **Assignments** – There are 4 programming assignments to test student's ability to write programs in Java each equally weighted.
2. **Exercises** – There are different kind of exercises to test student’s understanding of the class materials and Java programming concepts on a lecture basis. There are about 19 to 20 exercises in total. The exercise’s types include code tracing, finding and fixing  errors, arranging blocks of scramble code (Parson’s problems), writing, analysis, and synthesis of Java programs. 
3. **Exams** – There are two exams (midterm and final), each equally weighted. 
4. **Class Participation** – There are 9 weekly discussion forums where students will be asked to comment or ask questions about what they read from assigned learning materials. Class 
participation also include 2 group activities. You will work in groups to complete some programming exercises. 

*The number of assessments and the points possible for exams, assignments and other activities are subject to change without notice.*

## Learning Outcomes
I. **Learn Actively** - *Learning is a personal, interactive process that results in greater expertise and a more comprehensive understanding of the world.*
* Build basic programs in an appropriate programming language. 
* Take responsibility for learning, for example by engaging in learning, both individually and with others, through reading, listening, observing, and applying knowledge and skills to the creation of software programs.
* Participate in exercises (in-class and/or online) designed to develop an understanding of object-oriented programming.

II.	**Think Critically, Creatively and Reflectively** - *Reason and imagination are fundamental to problem solving and critical examination of ideas.*
* Develop expertise in techniques and approaches to independently fix bugs in program source code.
* Develop and apply computer science knowledge in order to construct solutions to foundational programing problems.
* Demonstrate an intuitive understanding of each programming language construct.
* Construct meaning from expanding and conflicting information.

III. **Communicate with Clarity and Originality** - *The ability to exchange ideas and information is essential to personal growth, productive work, and societal vitality.*
* Present coherent, concise, impromptu presentations on one’s approach to solving a problem, including (but not limited) to intuitive explanations of the approach and detailed technical explanations of the approach.
* Clearly document problem solutions.
* Use written, spoken, and symbolic forms to convey concepts creatively. Some examples might include computer source code, inline English comments within computer source code, English essays or blog posts, and technical documentation.

IV. **Interact in Diverse and Complex Environments** - *Successful negotiation through our increasingly complex, interdependent, and global society requires knowledge and awareness of self and others, as well as enhanced interaction skills.*
* Collaborate with others in complicated, dynamic, and ambiguous situations.
* Identify when one needs additional help and actively reach out for appropriate help when it is needed.
* Interact in pairs and/or small groups to develop small programs.
* Work with peers to develop an understanding of the material, and to successfully apply that knowledge to the creation of software programs.
* Respect individual ways of arriving at answers, expressing results and processes.
