## Course Description
This introductory programming class emphasizes problem solving through exploration of 
computer programming, variable typing and assignment, basic control structures loops, 
branches,  functions,  subprograms,  and  arrays  using  a  language  such  as  Java.  Students  also explore how human culture affects the use of computer programs.    .

## Prerequisites:  
Completion of MATH 085 or MFUND 062 with a grade of 2.0 or higher or placement by testing 
into MATH 095 or above.

## Workplace Context
*How will the outcomes from this class be used in the workplace?*   
*Scenario*:  Shira  is  hired  to  create  a  simple  address  book  with  a  graphical  user  interface.  She designs  an  interface,  creates  algorithms  dealing  with  basic  input  and  processing  of  names, addresses and phone numbers. She presents the design to the company and then implements the program and tests that it functions properly.

1. **Assignments** – There are 4 programming assignments to test student's ability to write programs in Java each equally weighted.
2. **Exercises** – There are different kind of exercises to test student’s understanding of the class materials and Java programming concepts on a lecture basis. There are about 19 to 20 exercises in total. The exercise’s types include code tracing, finding and fixing  errors, arranging blocks of scramble code (Parson’s problems), writing, analysis, and synthesis of Java programs. 
3. **Exams** – There are two exams (midterm and final), each equally weighted. 
4. **Class Participation** – There are 9 weekly discussion forums where students will be asked to comment or ask questions about what they read from assigned learning materials. Class 
participation also include 2 group activities. You will work in groups to complete some programming exercises. 

*The number of assessments and the points possible for exams, assignments and other activities are subject to change without notice.*
