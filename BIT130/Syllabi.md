## Course Description
The role of a network administrator is to manage the overall integrity of the network. This course prepares 
students  to  become  network  administrators  of  client/server  networks.  Students  will  learn  how  to  plan, 
deliver, operate, and manage servers to increase the reliability and flexibility of network server 
infrastructures. Key topics include server installation techniques, server roles, server performance 
management, and server maintenance. This course is geared toward the Microsoft Installing and Configuring 
Windows Server industry certification.

## Prerequisites
Co-enrollment with or completion of BIT 102 with a grade of 2.0 or higher, or instructor permission.

## Workplace Context
*How will the outcomes from this class be used in the workplace?*   
*Scenario*:  A small company, RexusWare, has several servers that all include important data that changes often. Unfortunately, when Julie tries to back up these servers, it takes about 30 hours to complete. What would Julie recommend to her team manager as a backup strategy? It is recommended that some type of backup is performed at least once daily since the data is important and changes often. A full back up should be scheduled for the weekends and differential or incremental backups performed daily (e.g., at midnight). Alternatively, the programs themselves might be isolated and their data backed up each night while a full backup of everything on the servers could be scheduled to run over the weekend.

## Classroom Conduct
Following these simple guidelines will help me to offer an enjoyable teaching environment for you. You are expected to join class prepared and on time. Joining late and/or unprepared is disrespectful and disruptive both to me and the other students in class. If you must join late, mute your speaker before joining the class. If you have any personal concerns, please feel free to talk to me at the end of class. The official Standards of Student Conduct policy is available in the student handbook.   
Please remember to respect the following list for me and the students in the class.
* Please remember to respect other students and your instructor by not using inappropriate language.
* Please silence your mobile devices such as cell phones.
* Do not play computer games or visit gaming websites during class times.
* No chat or messenger programs during class times.
* Do not use personal audio devices such as MP3 players during class times.
* No Internet surfing, texting, or other mobile device activity that can distract you. 

## Withdrawals
If you decide to drop, it is your responsibility to turn in a withdrawal to Enrollment Services. Do not assume that you will be dropped automatically. Please see the instructional calendar on the college website.

## Late Assignments Policy:   
**Quizzes are locked at the due date. If you miss a quiz it cannot be re-opened since the quiz answers are published once locked.**  

Each student receives two 48-hour *late work* tokens that can be used only on labs, throughout the quarter. After you have used your tokens, **any late Labs, will automatically lose 5% per day, and up to 25% reduction in their total points.** If you miss a graded activity due to a genuine absence, you must contact me during the first-class period of your return to arrange to complete the work and have it graded. Do not expect me to contact you regarding missed work. Any missed work that remains ungraded at the last day of the semester will receive a zero, regardless of whether the absence was excused.

## Academic Honesty
Cascadia College regards acts of academic dishonesty, including such activities as plagiarism, cheating and/or violations of integrity in information technology, as very serious offenses.  Academic honesty violations include, but are not limited to, copying homework, quiz and/or exam problems, and placing your name on a group project when you did not actively participate. If cheating, plagiarism, or other forms of academic honesty violations are discovered in student’s work, that Lab/lab/assignment will be awarded a zero grade. If the trends continue in more than three graded assignments, the student will be awarded a 0.0 as the final grade for the class.

A formal complaint with detailed description of all such academic dishonesty incidents will be forwarded to the student conduct officer, where a file of such occurrences is maintained. The Student Conduct Officer may institute further action against a student according to the college’s disciplinary policies and procedures. [Click here to see the policies and procedures in the Student Handbook.](https://www.cascadia.edu/academic_resources/handbook.aspx)

## Inclement Weather and Power Outages
If you cannot come to class because of any adverse weather conditions or other related issues, you should contact me as soon as possible. Likewise, if I will not be able to come to class for any reason, I will notify you of any cancellation or change as soon as possible. If you cannot complete an Lab or assignment due to power outage or internet issues, I will postpone any scheduled tests, Labs, assignments, and other assessments to a later date.

## COVID-19 Related Protocols and Pivot Plans
As mandated by the state of Washington and the Cascadia college, students must come to class wearing face masks. If for any reason I (Instructor) become sick due to COVID infection or need to self-isolate, you (the students) will be informed, and the teaching modality will change to remote synchronous instruction (Zoom). If any student becomes sick due to COVID infection, such student must use the daily attestation email from the college to report and self-isolate immediately. It is important that the instructor is informed about any sick student (especially if it is COVID related) so that we can take necessary precautions, and to make exceptions relative to any scheduled tests or assignments.
