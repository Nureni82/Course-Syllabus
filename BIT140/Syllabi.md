## Course Description
Active Directory is an essential entity for system administrators to manage the identities and relationships that make up an organization's network. This course will teach students how to design an Active Directory Infrastructure in a client/server environment. Students will install and configure directory services and will learn how to design directory forests, domain infrastructure, sites and replication, administrative structures, group  policies,  and  Public  Key  Infrastructures.  Students  will  also  learn  how  to  design  for  security, high availability,  disaste recovery, and migrations. This course is geared toward the Microsoft Administering Windows Server industry certification

## Prerequisites
Completion of BIT 130 with a grade of 2.0 or higher.

## Workplace Context
*How will the outcomes from this class be used in the workplace?*   
*Scenario*:  A growing company, PlexusWare has ten sites throughout the country and five major departments. Hiran's manager has asked him to design 
the Active Directory structure. How might this look? Hiran might consider using one domain with two different approaches (depending on management  needs). One approach is to have five OUs for each department with OUs for sites inside each department or to have an OU for each department with OUs for each site in the department OUs.

## Classroom Conduct
Following these simple guidelines will help me to offer an enjoyable teaching environment for you. You are expected to join class prepared and on time. Joining late and/or unprepared is disrespectful and disruptive both to me and the other students in class. If you must join late, mute your speaker before joining the class. If you have any personal concerns, please feel free to talk to me at the end of class. The official Standards of Student Conduct policy is available in the student handbook.   
Please remember to respect the following list for me and the students in the class.
* Please remember to respect other students and your instructor by not using inappropriate language.
* Please silence your mobile devices such as cell phones.
* Do not play computer games or visit gaming websites during class times.
* No chat or messenger programs during class times.
* Do not use personal audio devices such as MP3 players during class times.
* No Internet surfing, texting, or other mobile device activity that can distract you. 

## Withdrawals
If you decide to drop, it is your responsibility to turn in a withdrawal to Enrollment Services. Do not assume that you will be dropped automatically. Please see the instructional calendar on the college website.

## Late Assignments Policy:   
**Quizzes are locked at the due date. If you miss a quiz it cannot be re-opened since the quiz answers are published once locked.**  

Each student receives two 48-hour *late work* tokens that can be used only on labs, throughout the quarter. After you have used your tokens, **any late Labs, will automatically lose 5% per day, and up to 25% reduction in their total points.** If you miss a graded activity due to a genuine absence, you must contact me during the first-class period of your return to arrange to complete the work and have it graded. Please do not expect me to contact you regarding missed work. Any missed work that remains ungraded at the last day of the semester will receive a zero, regardless of whether the absence was excused.

## Academic Honesty
Cascadia College regards acts of academic dishonesty, including such activities as plagiarism, cheating and/or violations of integrity in information technology, as very serious offenses.  Academic honesty violations include, but are not limited to, copying homework, quiz and/or exam problems, and placing your name on a group project when you did not actively participate. If cheating, plagiarism, or other forms of academic honesty violations are discovered in student’s work, that Lab/lab/assignment will be awarded a zero grade. If the trends continue in more than three graded assignments, the student will be awarded a 0.0 as the final grade for the class.

A formal complaint with detailed description of all such academic dishonesty incidents will be forwarded to the student conduct officer, where a file of such occurrences is maintained. The Student Conduct Officer may institute further action against a student according to the college’s disciplinary policies and procedures. [Click here to see the policies and procedures in the Student Handbook.](https://www.cascadia.edu/academic_resources/handbook.aspx)

## Inclement Weather and Power Outages
If you cannot come to class because of any adverse weather conditions or other related issues, you should contact me as soon as possible. Likewise, if I will not be able to come to class for any reason, I will notify you of any cancellation or change as soon as possible. If you cannot complete an Lab or assignment due to power outage or internet issues, I will postpone any scheduled tests, Labs, assignments, and other assessments to a later date.

## COVID-19 Related Protocols and Pivot Plans
Cascadia's students and employees are no longer mandated to wear masks. However, the College Management highly recommend that all employees, students, and guests continue to wear their masks. If for any reason I (Instructor) become sick due to COVID infection or need to self-isolate, you (the students) will be informed, and the teaching modality will change to remote synchronous instruction (Zoom). If any student becomes sick due to COVID infection, such student must use the daily attestation email from the college to report and self-isolate immediately. It is important that the instructor is informed about any sick student (especially if it is COVID related) so that we can take necessary precautions, and to make exceptions relative to any scheduled tests or assignments.
