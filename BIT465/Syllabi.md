## Course Description
Most modern mobile applications communicate with a server, whether it’s sending game scores, posting updates, downloading videos, or receiving notifications. Students will build a backend system implementing Representational State Transfer (REST) endpoints for creating, reading, updating and deleting data with their apps. The students will learn about Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and how it can be leveraged to build and interact with database systems.

## Prerequisites
Admission to the BAS-IT program, AND Completion of BIT 340, BIT 372, and BIT 382 with a grade of 2.0 or higher.

## Workplace Context
*How will the outcomes from this class be used in the workplace?*   
*Scenario*:  Bokamoso works on a team that develops mobile applications for iOS and Android.  Their current project requires that their app access data stored in the cloud.  Bokamoso creates a program that runs on a Platform-as-a-Service offering; the program provides a REST API for both iOS and Android mobile apps to use.  Bokamoso utilizes software engineering best practices through the development process, including using version control software such as git, project management techniques and support tools, and both ad hoc and automated testing. Bokamoso successfully delivers the software, enabling her team to successfully complete the mobile app development project.

## Classroom Conduct
Following these simple guidelines will help me to offer an enjoyable teaching environment for you. You are expected to join class prepared and on time. Joining late and/or unprepared is disrespectful and disruptive both to me and the other students in class. If you must join late, mute your speaker before joining the class. If you have any personal concerns, please feel free to talk to me at the end of class. The official Standards of Student Conduct policy is available in the student handbook.   
Please remember to respect the following list for me and the students in the class.
* Please remember to respect other students and your instructor by not using inappropriate language.
* Please silence your mobile devices such as cell phones.
* Do not play computer games or visit gaming websites during class times.
* No chat or messenger programs during class times.
* Do not use personal audio devices such as MP3 players during class times.
* No Internet surfing, texting, or other mobile device activity that can distract you. 

## Withdrawals
If you decide to drop, it is your responsibility to turn in a withdrawal to Enrollment Services. Do not assume that you will be dropped automatically. Please see the instructional calendar on the college website.

## Late Assignments Policy:   
Each student receives two 48-hour *late work* tokens that can be used only on exercises and assignments, throughout the quarter. After you have used your tokens, **any late exercises and assignments, will automatically lose 5% per day, and up to 25% reduction in their total points.** If you miss a graded activity due to a genuine absence, you must contact me during the first-class period of your return to arrange to complete the work and have it graded. Do not expect me to contact you regarding missed work. Any missed work that remains ungraded at the last day of the semester will receive a zero, regardless of whether the absence was excused.

## Academic Honesty
Cascadia College regards acts of academic dishonesty, including such activities as plagiarism, cheating and/or violations of integrity in information technology, as very serious offenses.  Academic honesty violations include, but are not limited to, copying homework, quiz and/or exam problems, and placing your name on a group project when you did not actively participate. If cheating, plagiarism, or other forms of academic honesty violations are discovered in student’s work, that Lab/lab/assignment will be awarded a zero grade. If the trends continue in more than three graded assignments, the student will be awarded a 0.0 as the final grade for the class.

A formal complaint with detailed description of all such academic dishonesty incidents will be forwarded to the student conduct officer, where a file of such occurrences is maintained. The Student Conduct Officer may institute further action against a student according to the college’s disciplinary policies and procedures. [Click here to see the policies and procedures in the Student Handbook.](https://www.cascadia.edu/academic_resources/handbook.aspx)

## Inclement Weather and Power Outages
If you cannot join the class because of any adverse weather conditions, power outages, or internet issues, you should contact me as soon as possible. Likewise, if I will not be able to join the class for any reason, I will notify you of any cancellation or change as soon as possible. If you cannot join the class due to inclement weather, power outage/internet issues, I will make exception relative to the class attendance requirement, and postpone any scheduled tests, exercises, assignments, and other assessments to a later date.

## COVID-19 Related Protocols and Pivot Plans
Cascadia College is a vaccinated community as mandated by Washington State Government. Although the instruction delivery modality for this class is *mostly* synchronous (Zoom), it is important that the instructor is informed about any sick student (especially if it is COVID), so that exceptions can be made relative to any scheduled assignments. Cascadia College COVID-19 policies and resources are available [here](https://www.cascadia.edu/services/emergency/coronavirus.aspx). Please check the link for regular updates on COVID-19.
