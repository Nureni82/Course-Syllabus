1. **Assignments** – There are 4 programming assignments to test student's ability to write programs in Java each equally weighted.
2. **Exercises** – There are different kind of exercises to test student’s understanding of the class materials and Java programming concepts on a lecture basis. There are about 19 to 20 exercises in total. The exercise’s types include code tracing, finding and fixing  errors, arranging blocks of scramble code (Parson’s problems), writing, analysis, and synthesis of Java programs. 
3. **Exams** – There are two exams (midterm and final), each equally weighted. 
4. **Class Participation** – There are 9 weekly discussion forums where students will be asked to comment or ask questions about what they read from assigned learning materials. Class 
participation also include 2 group activities. You will work in groups to complete some programming exercises. 

**Assignments** *can be resubmitted **once** for a regrade. You can only get 50% of the lost points for any regraded assignments*

*The number of assessments and the points possible for exams, assignments and other activities are subject to change without notice.*

## Learning Outcomes
I. **Learn Actively** - *Learning is a personal, interactive process that results in greater expertise and a more comprehensive understanding of the world.*
* Build basic programs in an appropriate programming language. 
* Take responsibility for learning, for example by engaging in learning, both individually and with others, through reading, listening, observing, and applying knowledge and skills to the creation of software programs.
* Participate in exercises (in-class and/or online) designed to develop an understanding of object-oriented programming.

II.	**Think Critically, Creatively and Reflectively** - *Reason and imagination are fundamental to problem solving and critical examination of ideas.*
* Develop expertise in techniques and approaches to independently fix bugs in program source code.
* Develop and apply computer science knowledge in order to construct solutions to foundational programing problems.
* Demonstrate an intuitive understanding of each programming language construct.
* Construct meaning from expanding and conflicting information.

III. **Communicate with Clarity and Originality** - *The ability to exchange ideas and information is essential to personal growth, productive work, and societal vitality.*
* Present coherent, concise, impromptu presentations on one’s approach to solving a problem, including (but not limited) to intuitive explanations of the approach and detailed technical explanations of the approach.
* Clearly document problem solutions.
* Use written, spoken, and symbolic forms to convey concepts creatively. Some examples might include computer source code, inline English comments within computer source code, English essays or blog posts, and technical documentation.

IV. **Interact in Diverse and Complex Environments** - *Successful negotiation through our increasingly complex, interdependent, and global society requires knowledge and awareness of self and others, as well as enhanced interaction skills.*
* Collaborate with others in complicated, dynamic, and ambiguous situations.
* Identify when one needs additional help and actively reach out for appropriate help when it is needed.
* Interact in pairs and/or small groups to develop small programs.
* Work with peers to develop an understanding of the material, and to successfully apply that knowledge to the creation of software programs.
* Respect individual ways of arriving at answers, expressing results and processes.

## Classroom Conduct
Following these simple guidelines will help me to offer an enjoyable teaching environment for you. You are expected to join class prepared and on time. Joining late and/or unprepared is disrespectful and disruptive both to me and the other students in class. If you must join late, mute your speaker before joining the class. If you have any personal concerns, please feel free to talk to me at the end of class. The official Standards of Student Conduct policy is available in the student handbook.   
Please remember to respect the following list for me and the students in the class.
* Please remember to respect other students and your instructor by not using inappropriate language.
* Please silence your mobile devices such as cell phones.
* Do not play computer games or visit gaming websites during class times.
* No chat or messenger programs during class times.
* Do not use personal audio devices such as MP3 players during class times.
* No Internet surfing, texting, or other mobile device activity that can distract you. 

## Withdrawals
If you decide to drop, it is your responsibility to turn in a withdrawal to Enrollment Services. Do not assume that you will be dropped automatically. Please see the instructional calendar on the college website.

## Missed/Late Work
**To encourage you to work regularly, late exercises, assignments, discussion posts, and group activities will automatically lose 5% per day, and up to 25% reduction in their total points.** If you miss a graded activity due to a genuine absence, you must contact the instructor during the first-class period of your return to arrange to complete the work and have it graded. Do not expect the instructor to contact you regarding missed work. Any missed work that remains ungraded at the last day of the semester will receive a zero, regardless of whether the absence was excused.

## Academic Honesty
Cascadia College regards acts of academic dishonesty, including such activities as plagiarism, cheating and/or violations of integrity in information technology, as very serious offenses.  Academic honesty violations include, but are not limited to, copying homework, quiz and/or exam problems, and placing your name on a group project when you did not actively participate. If cheating, plagiarism, or other forms of academic honesty violations are discovered in student’s work, that exercise/lab/assignment will be awarded a zero grade. If the trends continue in more than three graded assignments, the student will be awarded a 0.0 as the final grade for the class.

A formal complaint with detailed description of all such academic dishonesty incidents will be forwarded to the student conduct officer, where a file of such occurrences is maintained. The Student Conduct Officer may institute further action against a student according to the college’s disciplinary policies and procedures. [Click here to see the policies and procedures in the Student Handbook.](https://www.cascadia.edu/academic_resources/handbook.aspx)

## Inclement Weather and Power Outages
If you cannot come to class because of any adverse weather conditions or other related issues, you should contact me as soon as possible. Likewise, if I will not be able to come to class for any reason, I will notify you of any cancellation or change as soon as possible. If you cannot complete an exercise or assignment due to power outage or internet issues, I will postpone any scheduled tests, exercises, assignments, and other assessments to a later date.

## COVID-19 Related Protocols and Pivot Plans
As mandated by the state of Washington and the Cascadia college, students must come to class wearing face masks. If for any reason I (Instructor) become sick due to COVID infection or need to self-isolate, you (the students) will be informed, and the teaching modality will change to remote synchronous instruction (Zoom). If any student becomes sick due to COVID infection, such student must use the daily attestation email from the college to report and self-isolate immediately. It is important that the instructor is informed about any sick student (especially if it is COVID related) so that we can take necessary precautions, and to make exceptions relative to any scheduled tests or assignments.
