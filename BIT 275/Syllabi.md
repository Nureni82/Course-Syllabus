## Course Description
Students learn the basics of the planning and design of databases, the use of the Structured Query Language (SQL), and the use of JSON notation for transmitting data. Students gain hands-on experience by creating and testing a complete data model based on a set of client objectives. Topics of study include information 
design, relational database concepts, data modeling (DML) and data definition (DDL) language syntax, database design process, conceptual vs physical data modeling, SQL and NoSQL database provisioning, and project scoping.

## Prerequisites
Co-enrollment with or completion of BIT 158 with grades of at least 2.0 or instructor permission.

## Workplace Context
*How will the outcomes from this class be used in the workplace?* *Scenario*: Roen is asked to create a database for a company that wishes to track client's name, address, purchase orders, and account status. In addition, the company wishes to create a database to hold their existing product catalog. The data need to be related to each other so that information like a purchasing order can be cross-referenced with the product catalog. 
Roen meets with clients, to ascertain their needs, scope the project, and creates a preliminary data layout and database prototype for their review. Roen then incorporates their feedback into a final database design in preparation for implementing the solution.

## Course Content, Topic, and Themes:
* Articulate the basic concepts of relational database theory, database design and organization.
* Gather data to effectively identify database requirements and define a scope of work.
* Analyze a given set of requirements for a database design project and define objectives.
* Develop comprehensive entity-relationship models that ensure data integrity.
* Assess a data model for inconsistencies and efficiencies; recommend appropriate modifications.

## Learning Outcomes
I. **Learn Actively** - *Learning is a personal, interactive process that results in greater expertise and a more comprehensive understanding of the world.*
*  Engage in meaningful design practice, meeting deadlines and ensuring complete, quality deliverables.
*  Create effective data models to engage in learning, both individually and with others.
*  Demonstrate responsibility for learning within group activities.
*  Develop an effective, usable database design using a typical data design methodology.
*  Use industry-standard development tools to create a prototype design for testing.
*  Perform integrity testing at appropriate stages of the development process..

II.	**Think Critically, Creatively and Reflectively** - *Reason and imagination are fundamental to problem solving and critical examination of ideas.*
* Evaluate existing data designs to assess and describe effective (and not-so-effective) design elements.
* Solve complex query problems using Structured Query Language.
* Compare and contrast database management systems for gathering, storing, and using data.
* Make design trade-off decisions that balance project objectives and data model integrity.
* Reflect on time-on-task requirements for different project phases.
* Recognize and solve data modeling problems using creativity, analysis, and intuition.

III. **Communicate with Clarity and Originality** - *The ability to exchange ideas and information is essential to personal growth, productive work, and societal vitality.*
* Communicate the project plan in effective, precise, and understandable ways.
* Organize individual and group presentations to articulate the data design and objectives for a range of audiences.
* Incorporate feedback effectively into design drafts and modifications.
* Support future development with the creation of an organized, concise documentation of the data design.

IV. **Interact in Diverse and Complex Environments** - *Successful negotiation through our increasingly complex, interdependent, and global society requires knowledge and awareness of self and others, as well as enhanced interaction skills.*
* Demonstrate effective group process and communication about a database design.
* Interact within groups to review and assess proposed database designs.
* Demonstrate respect for individual ways of arriving at answers, expressing results and processes.
* Use online development and version control tools to coordinate collaborations.

## Classroom Conduct
Following these simple guidelines will help me to offer an enjoyable teaching environment for you. You are expected to join class prepared and on time. Joining late and/or unprepared is disrespectful and disruptive both to me and the other students in class. If you must join late, mute your speaker before joining the class. If you have any personal concerns, please feel free to talk to me at the end of class. The official Standards of Student Conduct policy is available in the student handbook.   
Please remember to respect the following list for me and the students in the class.
* Please remember to respect other students and your instructor by not using inappropriate language.
* Please silence your mobile devices such as cell phones.
* Do not play computer games or visit gaming websites during class times.
* No chat or messenger programs during class times.
* Do not use personal audio devices such as MP3 players during class times.
* No Internet surfing, texting, or other mobile device activity that can distract you. 

## Withdrawals
If you decide to drop, it is your responsibility to turn in a withdrawal to Enrollment Services. Do not assume that you will be dropped automatically. Please see the instructional calendar on the college website.

## Late Assignments Policy:   
**Quizzes are locked at the due date. If you miss a quiz it cannot be re-opened since the quiz answers are published once locked..**  

Each student receives two 48-hour *late work* tokens that can be used only on exercises and assignments, throughout the quarter. After you have used your tokens, **any late exercises and assignments, will automatically lose 5% per day, and up to 25% reduction in their total points.** If you miss a graded activity due to a genuine absence, you must contact me during the first-class period of your return to arrange to complete the work and have it graded. Please do not expect me to contact you regarding missed work. Any missed work that remains ungraded at the last day of the semester will receive a zero, regardless of whether the absence was excused.

## Academic Honesty
Cascadia College regards acts of academic dishonesty, including such activities as plagiarism, cheating and/or violations of integrity in information technology, as very serious offenses.  Academic honesty violations include, but are not limited to, copying homework, quiz and/or exam problems, and placing your name on a group project when you did not actively participate. If cheating, plagiarism, or other forms of academic honesty violations are discovered in student’s work, that Lab/lab/assignment will be awarded a zero grade. If the trends continue in more than three graded assignments, the student will be awarded a 0.0 as the final grade for the class.

A formal complaint with detailed description of all such academic dishonesty incidents will be forwarded to the student conduct officer, where a file of such occurrences is maintained. The Student Conduct Officer may institute further action against a student according to the college’s disciplinary policies and procedures. [Click here to see the policies and procedures in the Student Handbook.](https://www.cascadia.edu/academic_resources/handbook.aspx)

## Inclement Weather and Power Outages
If you cannot come to class because of any adverse weather conditions or other related issues, you should contact me as soon as possible. Likewise, if I will not be able to come to class for any reason, I will notify you of any cancellation or change as soon as possible. If you cannot complete an Lab or assignment due to power outage or internet issues, I will postpone any scheduled tests, Labs, assignments, and other assessments to a later date.

## COVID-19 Related Protocols and Pivot Plans
Cascadia's students and employees are no longer mandated to wear masks. However, the College Management highly recommend that all employees, students, and guests continue to wear their masks. If for any reason I (Instructor) become sick due to COVID infection or need to self-isolate, you (the students) will be informed, and the teaching modality will change to remote synchronous instruction (Zoom). If any student becomes sick due to COVID infection, such student must use the daily attestation email from the college to report and self-isolate immediately. It is important that the instructor is informed about any sick student (especially if it is COVID related) so that we can take necessary precautions, and to make exceptions relative to any scheduled tests or assignments.
